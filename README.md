# Crypto_Clustering

1.	Title: Module 19 Challenge-crypto-Clustering
2.	Description: The focus of the Module 19 Challenge is to use  Python and unsupervised learning to predict cryptocurrencies.
The following are the key areas covered:
  I.	Preparing the Data
  II.	Finding the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
  III.Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
  IV.	Optimize Clusters with Principle Component Analysis
  V.	Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA data
  VI.	Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
  VII.	

3.	Using Python and Unsupervised Learning to predict cryptocurrencies:
  a.	Use the elbow method to find the best value for (k)
  b.	Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for (k)
  c.	From the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.
  d.	Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for (k)
  e.	Use the K-means model with the best value for (k)

4.	Usage
  a) The Module 19 Crypto Currencies Challenge folder will have a Resources folder that contains the Crypto_Market_Data CSV file, the Challenge folder will also have the Crypto Clustering Jupyter Notebook, and the README file. 
  b) In order to achieve the coding outputs described above, the script sequencing for the Crypto-Currencies Challenge requirements are as follows: 
      i.	CSV Data File
  a.	The raw data that is needed in order to load into a Dataframe.
      ii.	Jupyter Notebook File
  a.	Needed to write and execute code in an interactive environment to produce data visualizations.
      iii.	JavaScript:
  a.	Enables the interactivity and dynamic content handling. Contains the code the fetches and processes the earthquake data.

5.	Dependencies 
  a. Proper use of Unsupervised learning 
  b. Clustering data sets 
  c. Applying K-means algorithms 
  d. Cluster Optimization using the Elbow Method


5.	Known Issues: Issues with the script. 
  a)	There were no know issues with the script that I am aware of.
